/**
 * About This Project
Welcome to API DocBot, a side project built to test capabilities in React and AI-powered API documentation generation. This tool allows users to enter an API endpoint, fetch its documentation, and receive a structured explanation, including available methods, request/response formats, authentication requirements, and usage examples.

Why This Project?
This project was created as an experiment to explore:

React Hooks â€“ Managing state and UI updates dynamically.
AI Integration â€“ Using Hugging Faceâ€™s Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 model to generate API documentation explanations.
Asynchronous Data Handling â€“ Fetching and displaying AI-generated responses in real time.
Frontend UI/UX â€“ Designing a simple, interactive chat-like interface.
How It Works
Enter an API endpoint into the chatbox.
The AI fetches relevant documentation and explains it in a structured format.
The response is displayed in markdown format for easy readability.
Technologies Used
React (Vite Setup) for the frontend.
Hugging Face API for AI-powered responses.
CSS & UI Components for styling and responsiveness.
Future Enhancements
While this is a side project, potential improvements include:
âœ… Adding support for multiple AI models.
âœ… Enhancing UI with syntax highlighting for code snippets.
âœ… Caching previous responses for better performance.

This project is purely for experimentation and learningâ€”if you have suggestions, feel free to share! ðŸš€
